# Restaurant Order Analysis

This project analyzes restaurant data in order to uncover trends and insights into popular orders, customer behavior, and trends among top spenders.  

#### Main Objectives:
- **Understand Menu Items**: Explore the menu_items table to get an idea of what's on the menu.
- **Explore Orders Tables**: Explore the order_details table to get an idea of what data has been collected.
- **Understand Customer Behavior**: Analyze the menu_items and order_details tables to understand customer behavior.

#### Methodology

To analyze this data, I've used a combination of techniques such as:
 - **Joins**: To combine the `menu_items` and `order_details` tables.
 
 - **Subqueries**: To filter and aggregate data efficiently.

 - **Temporary Tables**: To simplify and avoid unnecessarily complex queries.
 
 - **Aggregate Functions**: To calculate key metrics such as averages, sums, and counts. 

#### Findings

Some of the key findings were:
- The most expensive dish is **Shrimp Scampi** and least expensive is **Edamame**. 
- The orders with the most number of items had **14 items**.
- Among the top 5 spend orders, **Italian food** was the most popular category.

#### Conclusion

This analysis provides valuable insights and recommendations into the restaurant's performance. Some takeaways include:  

- **High Volume Items**: Most expensive dishes pricing strategy can be optimized to maximize revenue. 
- **Customer Preferene**: Italian dishes dominate among the top spenders. This suggests a potential area to expand or market more aggressively.
